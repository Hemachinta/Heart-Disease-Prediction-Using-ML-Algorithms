# Description
Heart disease is a commonly occurring disease and is the major cause of sudden death 
now a days. This disease attacks the person instantly. Most people are not aware of the 
symptoms of heart disease. Timely attention and proper diagnosis of heart disease will reduce the mortality rate. Medical data mining is to explore hidden patterns from the data sets. In this project, we have applied five machine learning algorithms namely KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Navie Bayes predict the heart disease. Result shows that DT gives high accuracy score with 96% compare to other algorithms LR is 86%, RF is 90%, NB is 83%and KNN is 95%.
